  "description": "Adds a B-2 Spirit Bomber. In combination with the AircraftRealism mod you will be able to fly above your enemies, dropping bombs on them. When you reach the takeoff speed, the plane gets invincible to everything except 'flak' damage. This plane is a BOMBER. Use it only against ground targets as it deals NO anti-aircraft damage. ATTENTIONS: It gets very much fast you know? Like 900km/h kinda level fast...",
