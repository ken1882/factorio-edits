Consume lifesupport canisters for food & air

Equipment boosts the lifesupport drain efficiency, stacks additively.
All thruster suits have some base level lifesupport efficiency, 1 module is built-in.

Non-thruster suits can have modules added but only function on land and efficiency benefits are
halved. Only useful on hostile planets. A proper spacesuit is required in space.
