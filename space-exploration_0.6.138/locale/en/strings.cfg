space-exploration=Build Cargo Rockets to launch stuff into space. Ride a rocket into space yourself and start spacewalking. Build an orbital space platform to develop difficult data-driven space science. Build a spaceship tile by tile, fly it from a planet surface to other planets, moons, asteroid fields. Build interstellar death rays and deep space mining colonies. Explore ancient ruins on alien planets and relics lost in deep space.  Not recommended to play with non-dependency mods while in experimental phase.

page_space_exploration_text_1=Welcome to Space Exploration. There's a lot in the mod already, but it is still [font=default-bold]experimental[/font] status and is under heavy development. There may be bugs.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Experimental status?[/color][/font]\nSpace Exploration is still changing rapidly and I am putting all my time into progressing the development of the key features at the expense of mod compatibility. [color=red]It is not advisable to play with mods other than the required and recommended mods.[/color]\n\nWhile in experimental status: If a mod causes problems such as corrupted game/save state, crashes, invalid tech trees, or core gameplay it will quickly be marked as incompatible to protect new players. This means if you use a lot of mods it is more likely one may be marked as incompatible later due to an issue you had not yet discovered. You are of course free to edit your info.json file to try incompatible mods but you do so at your own risk: if your game state becomes unplayable because of it I won't be able to help you.\n\nThere is some additional information relating to mod compatibility on the Space Exploration wiki.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Recommended mods[/color][/font]\n • Module Inserter. Allows you to put modules in machines from satellite view.\n • Grappling Gun. Allows you to jump over buildings, across lakes, and out of combat if you get slowed. In space you can get back to space platform if you fall off. Also lets you board spaceships (especially useful if they are moving).\n • Inserter Fuel Leech. This is just for the AAI burner phase, it lets burner inserters fuel themselves from the entity they are collecting from.\n • Text Plates Allows you to put text on the ground, useful for marking planet names, station names, spaceship docking zones, etc.\n • Combat Mechanics Overhaul. Can help with defences when off planet if you enable the "Walls Block Spitters" option. It is cheaper to repair walls than turrets. \n • Bullet Trails. Faint lines follow your bullets so you can see where they are going, or what gun turrets are shooting at. (Also looks better.)\n • Milestones. Keeps track of your milestones and how fast you reached them.\n • FNEI or Recipe Book. A recipe browser.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Overhaul mods[/color][/font]\nSpace Exploration standalone already takes people between 70 and 700 hours to complete, with the average around 400 hours. It is NOT recommended to play with other overhaul mods as they tend to break a lot of the per-planet resource balance, item logistics, building patterns, and general game progression. If it is your first time playing Space Exploration you should avoid other overhaul mods otherwise you won't know what has been broken.\n\n Most other overhaul mods are marked as incompatible if the tech tree is significantly broken. The long term intention is to add compatibility with a select few overhaul mods making sure that the main mechanics and features of both are preserved to the satisfaction of both mod developers.\n Krastorio 2 is an example of this work already substantially underway.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Recommended settings[/color][/font]\nYou MUST have all alien biomes terrain tiles enabled, otherwise the game will crash at a later point.\n\nAs the game is longer than normal, it is a good idea to start a game with low enemy evolution factors.\n\nYou should not set high resources settings for your starting planet unless you are playing with resource intensive recipes, such as high difficulty recipes or marathon mode. If resources are set too high it will reduce the need to expand to other planets.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Helpful urls[/color][/font]\nTake a look at the Space Exploration Wiki over here: [color=blue]https://spaceexploration.miraheze.org[/color]\nGet help or follow the development on Discord: [color=blue]https://discord.gg/ymjUVMv[/color]\n\nI've put over 4000 hours into this mod.

menu_meteor_defence=[img=virtual-signal/se-meteor] Meteor Defence
title_meteor_defence=Meteor Defence
page_meteor_defence_text_1=Meteors fall from the sky and damage what they land on. Most meteors are made of minerals, but certain planets may have special meteor types. Meteor showers hit most zones at random intervals. You can change the max interval between strikes in mod settings.\n\nThe number of meteors in each meteor shower is randomized, 50% for 1, 25% for 2, 12.5% for 3, 6.25% for 4, and so on.\n\nThe meteor defence structures can shoot at meteors. They fire in sequence, so later defences won't all fire if all the meteors were destroyed. Defences require ammo, charge time, and additional power while charging. The power draw is not insignificant, so it is wise to balance risk against cost.\n\n[img=item/se-meteor-defence] [color=#ffe6c0][font=heading-2]Defenses Installations[/font][/color]\nUnlike [img=item/se-meteor-point-defence] Meteor point defences that can only protect a limited area of a single zone from meteors, [img=item/se-meteor-defence] Meteor defence installations are capable of protecting two zones at once. In particular, any meteor defence installations placed on a zone can also protect that zone's orbit and vice-versa.\n\n[img=item/se-delivery-cannon-weapon-capsule] [color=#ffe6c0][font=heading-2]Hostile Deliveries[/font][/color]\nMeteor defences will also shoot down delivery cannon payloads sent by hostile forces (only relevant in multiplayer PvP).
menu_coremining=[img=item/se-core-miner] Core Mining
title_coremining=Core Mining
page_coremining_text_1=Core mining is a source of infinite resources but it requires a lot of power and the more you build the less efficient it is.\n\nCore mining can only be done on a Core Seam, found only on planets and moons. Every planet and moon has a specific type of core that determines the type of core seams they have, and the core seam determines the type of core fragment they yield. For example, a planet with a copper core will have copper core seams that give copper core fragments. The starting planet gives a balance of common resources but other places tend to mainly give 1 resource type.\n\nThe first core miner placed on a planet runs at 100% efficiency, but each additional miner placed reduces the efficiency of all the others on the same planet. Placing additional miners always increases the total core fragment output overall. To get 2x total output you need 2x2=4 miners, 3x output needs 3x3=9 miners, 10x output needs 10x10=100 miners. There are only so many core seams per planet with smaller planets having fewer suitable mining spots. Core mining on smaller planet/moons is slower over all, however the weaker gravity well makes it easier to get the resources off the surface.\n\nIn the early game it can be useful to have 1 core miner running when you have excess power. If you start on a tiny planet or islands then solar power plus core mining might be your only way to get enough resources to get off the planet.\n\nLate game core miners benefit greatly from mining productivity bonuses. It is better to aim for a few core miners on many planets rather than many core miners on a few planets.
menu_beacons=[img=item/se-wide-beacon-2] Beacons
title_beacons=Beacons
page_beacons_text_1=[color=#ffe6c0][font=heading-2]Beacon Overload[/font][/color] [img=virtual-signal/se-beacon-overload]\nBeacon Overload is an overhaul of Beacon mechanics in Factorio. Crafting machines can only be affected by 1 beacon, if affected by more beacons they overload and pause production.\n\nThe overhaul allows more modules in beacons and promotes the use of more powerful Modules in both beacons and assemblers for maximum bonuses. The change also allows and promotes a wider range of factory designs.\n\nThe Basic Beacon is individually much more powerful than a vanilla beacon, but cannot stack their effects on one machine so the maximum boost you can provide is reduced compared to vanilla. The more powerful beacons are able to far exceed the maximum boost on a machine available in Vanilla.\n\nStarting from Wide Area Beacon players can experience substantial amount in module savings as well as freedom to create complex design revolving around larger buildings or with multiple fluid or material inputs.\n\nMachines affected by more than one beacon will be marked with a Beacon Overload icon and pause all production. They will still continue to consume minimal power in the process.\n\nThe different beacon types are useful for different reasons. Basic beacons have a very low power draw so are useful for power-efficient builds. Wide area beacons have a huge area so are the most module-efficient option if you can affect many machines. Compact beacons have a small area but high transmission efficiency, so are more module-efficient if a larger area would be wasted.
menu_launching_satellites=[img=item/satellite] Launching Satellites

This mode can be accessed with the [__CONTROL__se-remote-view__] key. While in satellite view, your camera is detached from your character so you can quickly look around the map and even uncover new areas. There are some things you can't do in satellite view, like directly placing or mining entities. There is a lot you can do though, like using blueprints, deconstruction planners, placing ghost entities, ordering wire connections, changing machine recipes, combinator settings, etc.\n\n[img=se-map-gui-universe-explorer] [font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Universe Explorer[/color] [__CONTROL__se-universe-explorer__][/font]\nThe Navigation Satellite network also lets you view other surfaces, like other planets, moons, asteroid belts, asteroid fields, and orbits. Press [__CONTROL__se-universe-explorer__] to bring up the list of known zones. You can then click View Surface to see what is there. It can be good to scout a planet a bit before you try to fly there.\n\nLaunching satellites also helps with zone discovery within the system it is launched from (see Zone Discovery for more details).\n\n[img=item/se-satellite-telemetry] [font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Satellite Telemetry[/color][/font]\nSatellite launches return satellite telemetry, a vital component in [img=item/se-rocket-science-pack] Rocket Science.\n\n[img=item/se-space-probe-rocket] [font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Space probes[/color][/font]\nThe [img=item/se-space-probe-rocket-silo] Space probe rocket silo is designed for use in space. Instead of building rockets, it launches pre-built [img=item/se-space-probe-rocket] Space probe rockets. A space probe rocket is much cheaper than a normal satellite rocket, and it can pre-assembled in a manufacturing hub instead of bringing resources to the rocket silo. A Space probe rocket silo can launch satellites cheaply, but can also launch more specialised probes and collectors from specific locations in space.

You may set hotkeys for Pinned Locations when adding or editing them. This allows you to quickly jump to important locations with the press of a keyboard button without needing to go through the Universe Explorer.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Temporary Pins[/color][/font]\nPinned Locations do not need to be set through the pin creation popup menu. They may also be set with the "Set Pin" hotkeys. This creates a Pinned Location without a name or icon, but can immediately be jumped to with the associated "Go to Pin" hotkey.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]All Pins[/color] [__CONTROL__se-remote-view-pins__][/font]\nPins are only displayed in the hotbar for the current surface you are viewing. However, hotkeys may be used to jump to a pin on another surface regardless of if it is visible in the hotbar. If you need to have an overview of all Pinned Locations, press [__CONTROL__se-remote-view-pins__] to bring up the list of all pins. Pins in this view are organized into rows based on the surface the pin is on. If a surface has only a single pin, its row will be collapsed into that of its parent star.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]AAI Programmable Vehicles[/color][/font]\nThe default hotkeys for setting and swapping to Pinned Locations conflict with the default hotkeys for creating and selecting control groups for AAI Programmable Vehicles. If you use both mods, you will need to adjust your hotkeys in order to get the expected behavior.

page_zone_discovery_text_1=There are lots of stars, planets, moons, asteroid belts, and asteroid fields in this area of space that can be discovered.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Navigation Satellite[/color][/font]\nYou can launch a navigation satellite to discover a random planet, moon, or asteroid belt in the same star system that the satellite was launched from. If there is nothing else to discover in that system then it can discover new stars instead, but cannot discover anything orbiting other stars or anything in deep space.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Zone Discovery Research[/color][/font]\nYou can use space telescopes to look for new zones to discover. This is achieved through "Zone Discover" research. The basic zone discovery research can find a random star, planet, moon, or asteroid belt.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Targeted Zone Discovery Research[/color][/font]\nTargeted zone discovery research is the same as the basic research, but if you have selected a resource preference (below) it looks in areas more likely for that resource to occur so you are more likely to discover a zone with that resource. Keep in mind that a planet can't be discovered before discovering its star, and a moon can't be discovered before discovering its planet. Don't expect to find what you're looking for every time.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Deep Space Zone Discovery Research[/color][/font]\nDeep space zone discovery research only looks for areas of interest in deep space and is the only way you can discover asteroid fields.

menu_space_capsule=[img=item/se-space-capsule] Space Capsule
title_space_capsule=Space Capsule
page_space_capsule_text_1=The space capsule is a small personal rocket and rocket navigation system. It can be placed on the ground to act as a small personal transport rocket, or used to construct a Cargo rocket where it acts as the rocket's guidance system and escape pod.\n\nThe Space capsule has its own lifesupport system, so if you are suffocating in space you can take shelter in a Space capsule.\n\nIf used in a Cargo rocket, the Space capsule is not lost. It will always survive the trip by either landing on the ground or landing in a Rocket landing pad.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Personal transport[/color][/font]\n[color=#f5cb48]The ability to use a space capsule standalone is locked by the "Space Capsule Navigation" technology.[/color] Once you have researched that technology the Space capsule can be used almost anywhere without the need for a cargo rocket silo.\n\nA standalone space capsule can be used to move your character but is not suitable for carrying cargo. While you can take a few essential items, like life support canisters, the capacity is extremely limited and any items you take may increase the fuel costs dramatically. If you are intending to use a space capsule you should be prepared to dump your entire inventory into a container and then take only what you need. If you need cost effective item transportation use a Cargo rocket instead.\n\nPlanet Launch: A Space capsule can launch from a planet but needs some help to do so. It needs to use some cargo rocket sections to build a disposable first stage to help get out of the atmosphere. The cargo rocket sections must be placed in the capsule's trunk along with the required rocket fuel. The cargo rocket sections used cannot be recovered.\n\nTravelling in space: You can travel between adjacent space zones, such as from planet orbit to the closest moon orbit, between moon orbits, or from outer moon orbits to an asteroid belt. While you can travel in interstellar space the available destinations are not reliable. Travelling from orbit to the planet or moon surface below is easier and does not have a capacity limit.\n\nReentry: The space capsule can land on a planet or moon for a small rocket fuel cost. Beware that the landing location is unpredictable, and you will need more fuel and cargo rocket sections to take off again.\n\nEmergency burn: The emergency burn will take you home using emergency fuel reserves. No additional fuel is required. It will be a rough landing that will damage capsule, resulting in a [img=item/se-space-capsule-scorched] Compromised space capsule, which will need to be refurbished to work again. You may lose up to 50% of any items in your character inventory taken on this journey (surviving results rounded up).
menu_cargo_rockets=[img=virtual-signal/se-cargo-rocket] Cargo Rockets

This will always be recovered at the destinations and can return you home from orbit.\n  • A lot of liquid rocket fuel, piped into one of the 8 connections near the corners. The amount of fuel required depends on the radius of the planet you're launching from and the distance to the destination. If using the "Any landing pad with name" destination option, it will load enough fuel for any of the valid destinations.\n\nIf a rocket is launched with empty cargo slots then some of the reserved fuel and cargo rocket sections will not be used. An empty rocket will still cost 50% of a filled rocket, so it is best to use full rockets if possible.\n\nYou can enter the cargo rocket silo from the door at the front (press __CONTROL__toggle-driving__). This will let you ride with the rocket. You should also have a thruster suit and lifesupport canisters so you don't die if you are launching to space. \n\nYour first rocket won't have anywhere to land so it will disassemble as the cargo is released. Sometimes rockets targeting a landing pad miss and the rocket crashes. Even in the case of a crash the cargo is deployed in cargo pods so you never lose all of the cargo. \n\nYou should take a Rocket Landing Pad with you so you can build somewhere for the next rocket to land. It is a good idea make use of empty space in the rocket by filling it with resources such as metals, stone, oil, coal, low density structures, heat shielding, and solid rocket fuel.\n\nBuilding a Rocket Landing Pad at your base before launching will allow you to easily return directly there instead of ending up in a random location when you return.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Destinations[/color][/font]\nOnce you have a landing pad placed, make sure you update the destination of the rocket silo to target the landing pad and not a random point in orbit. You can do this in-person or via the Satellite Remote View (hotkey 'n'). However, rockets will not launch to a landing pad that contains items, so make sure to empty it.\n\nMore distant destinations have less reliable delivery. Some destination types, such as asteroid fields have additional safety penalties, but these can be mitigated with research.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Basic Automation[/color][/font]\nThe rocket silo outputs signals for how many parts are already in the rocket. You can put a condition on an inserter of [Cargo Rocket Sections < 100] to make sure it won't fill the rocket with additional sections.\n\nIf you have set up launch triggers on a silo it will launch automatically, but a rocket won't automatically launch to a landing pad that isn't empty (otherwise the cargo might not fit).\n\nIf you select the destination as "Any landing pad with name", then it will search for all landing pads with the matching name on any surface. Carefully named landing pads combined with the inability to launch to a landing pad that is not empty can result in an easy to set up rocket logistic system.\n\n[font=heading-3][color=#ffe6c0]Input Signals[/color][/font]\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-green] Green signal: Can trigger a launch if the silo is configured to have a trigger that uses the green signal.\n\n[font=heading-3][color=#ffe6c0]Output Signals[/color][/font]\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-E] E Signal: Empty slots\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-F] F Signal: Full slots\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-L] L Signal: Liquid rocket fuel required for all potential destinations specified by the destinations setting.\n[img=virtual-signal/se-cargo-rocket] Cargo Rocket Signal: If the rocket is complete (i.e. 1 capsule and 100 rocket sections) then a value of 1 is returned.\n[img=item/se-space-capsule] Space Capsule Signal: Any capsules used in the rocket construction are added to the count of any capsules in the cargo inventory.\n[img=item/se-cargo-rocket-section] Cargo Rocket Section Signal: Any sections used in the rocket construction are added to the count of any sections in the cargo inventory.\n[img=fluid/se-liquid-rocket-fuel] Liquid Rocket Fuel Signal: The total liquid rocket fuel in the silo.
menu_delivery_cannons=[img=item/se-delivery-cannon] Delivery Cannons
title_delivery_cannons=Delivery Cannons
page_delivery_cannons_text_1=Delivery cannons are explosion-assisted railguns with interplanetary range. They are designed to fire sturdy homogeneous resources that can survive the sudden acceleration. They cannot fire more complicated manufactured intermediates or structures.\n\nA delivery cannon only has a target point, it does not have any understanding of what is at that point and will fire the payload as long as it has power and a filled delivery capsule. If you want to add conditions to the cannon’s ability to fire, you restrict the cannon’s ability to load resources or capsules.\n\nWhen a delivery capsule lands on the ground it damages the area and most of the resources are destroyed. A delivery cannon chest can safely catch the capsule as long as the chest is not full. You can have multiple cannons firing at the same chest with different resources.\n\nIt is advisable to either keep targeted chests empty, or restrict cannon inputs using signal transmission.\n\nDelivery cannons have a 1GJ capacity and draw 50MW when charging. The range of the delivery cannon is constrained by the amount of energy it can store. Firing at more distant locations takes more energy. Some destinations may require more energy than the delivery cannon can hold so it will never fire. You can set up a delivery cannon relay station in a location half way there to send the cargo in 2 stages.\n\n[img=item/se-delivery-cannon-weapon] [font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Weapon delivery[/color][/font]\nWeapon delivery cannons act similar to their non-weapon counterparts, but fire weapons instead of resources as their payload. In addition to the standard firing mode available to the delivery cannon, weapon delivery cannons also have the __1__ and __2__ modes.\n\n__1__ mode: The weapon delivery cannon automatically picks a new target every time it fires. Automatically shuts off when no more enemies remain in the zone it targets. Worms and nests are prioritized above moving enemies when selecting new targets. The automated firing mode is not as accurate as manual target selection - [color=cyan]1%[/color] of the time, it will misfire and hit a random position on the targeted zone.\n\n__2__ mode: The weapon delivery cannon is in standby until a player selects a target for it with a [img=item/se-delivery-cannon-artillery-targeter-se-iridium-piledriver] targeting remote. When any target is selected, one weapon delivery cannon with the corresponding ammo type and sufficient energy to fire at the selected location will fire at the chosen spot and then go back into standby. When multiple targets are selected using the targeting remote, they are queued - as weapon delivery cannons in __2__ mode become available, they will fire upon the queued targets. If a target selected with the [img=item/se-delivery-cannon-artillery-targeter-se-iridium-piledriver] targeting remote is not fired upon within a couple minutes, it expires - if this happens either build more weapon delivery cannons, or use __1__ mode instead.
menu_steam_power=[img=item/se-big-turbine] Steam Power
title_steam_power=Steam Power
page_steam_power_text_1=The steam power system in Space Exploration is greatly expanded. There are new ways to generate heat and steam, and new ways to consume steam to create electric power.\n\n[img=item/se-electric-boiler] [font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Electric Boilers[/color][/font]\nWhile the Boiler can only produce steam using fuel sources, the Electric boiler produces steam using electricity. The steam produced by the Electric boiler contains less energy than the electricity used to turn the water to steam, so it is not useful for normal power production and can't be used for an infinite energy loop. Instead the steam can be stored in storage tanks, saving the energy so that it can be used in energy production later. This can offer higher capacity energy storage than accumulators of the same cost, but is less energy efficient than accumulators. Higher temperature steam is even more space efficient.\n\nThe Electric boiler can make lower temperature steam for use in recipes that require steam but don't care about the temperature, or boil away water just to get rid of it.\n\n[img=item/se-condenser-turbine] [font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Condenser Turbines[/color][/font]\nSome places in Space Exploration lack any natural sources of water (ex. orbits or waterless planets). In these locations using steam power with Steam turbines may seem futile, since the constant stream of water required by Steam turbines could not all be supplied from off world sources. In these cases Condenser turbines come in incredibly handy. Condenser turbines act just like a normal Steam turbine with one key difference: rather than exhausting the incoming steam into the atmosphere, the steam is condensed back down into water and output from the turbine. This lets Condenser turbines be used in a (mostly) closed loop where only small amounts of water are required to top off the system. Do note that Condenser turbines are a little less power efficient than Steam turbines, meaning that you will get slightly less power out of the same amount of heat when run through Condenser turbines instead of Steam turbines; this is the tradeoff for recovering the water.\n\n[img=item/se-big-turbine] [font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]High Temperature Steam[/color][/font]\nAt a certain point, using steam to create vast amounts of power starts to become unwieldy due to the number of Steam turbines required. To circumvent this scaling problem, high temperature steam may be used as a replacement. Produced by High temperature heat exchangers, and consumed by High temperature turbine generators, high temperature steam is incredibly energy dense. It can be used to dramatically shrink the size of steam power production. In order to use High temperature heat exchangers, a source of heat is required. Nuclear reactors cannot get hot enough to work with High temperature heat exchangers. Instead either an Energy beam receiver or an Antimatter reactor must be used as the heat source. Standard Heat pipes are not capable of transferring high temperature heat; only Naquium heat pipes are capable of transferring high temperature heat. This means that until Naquium heat pipes are available, the High temperature heat exchangers must be placed directly next to the source of the high temperature heat.

Lifesupport equipment is designed to protect you from these hazards by providing you with appropriate pressurisation, oxygen, water, nutrition, thermal regulation, and radiation protection. The 2 main types of hostile environment are:\n\nSpace: A space suit (thruster suit) is required for lifesupport to function correctly in a vacuum. You cannot use lifesupport from some other type of armor in space, you will still suffocate.\n\nLand: Certain planets and moons may have dangers such as radiation, extreme cold, extreme heat, or an acidic atmosphere, and require lifesupport equipment. (Coming soon). Planets also require lifesupport if certain bio weapons are used (Plague Worlds). Lifesupport for these areas can be provided by a thruster suit, or by equipment placed into any other type of armor.

page_space_sciences_text_1=Most science packs can only be used in a [img=item/se-space-science-lab] Space Science Lab, which can only be used in space. To continue research you will need to get all your science packs in to space somehow (usually by cargo rocket). Initial suitable locations include: asteroid belts for in-situ resources, close orbit of a star for the best solar energy, the orbit of a planet or moon for main-base accessibility.\n\n[img=item/space-science-pack] The first in-space science is the Space science pack, it will help you learn the basics of space logistics.\n\nNext you have a choice of [img=item/production-science-pack] Production science or [img=item/utility-science-pack] Utility science. Both are made in space and mark the start of data-driven science. Make data cards, run the cards through supercomputers, and you (almost) always get the cards back at the end. To keep the supercomputers cool you'll need [img=fluid/se-space-coolant-hot] thermofluid and [img=item/se-space-radiator]radiators.\n\n[img=item/production-science-pack] Production science requires an outpost on a Vulcanite world. It provides access to beacons, mining productivity, productivity modules, Kovarex enrichment, and other things to boost your output. Production science leads you to [img=item/se-material-science-pack-1] Material and [img=item/se-biological-science-pack-1] Biological science.\n\n[img=item/utility-science-pack]Utility science requires an outpost on a Cryonite world.  It provides access to some game-changing technology, such as the robot logistic system, artillery, upgraded personal roboports, and upgraded power armor. Utility science leads on you [img=item/se-astronomic-science-pack-1] Astronomic and [img=item/se-energy-science-pack-1] Energy science.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Specialist Sciences[/color][/font]\nThe 4 specialist sciences are Astronomic, Biological, Energy and Material. They are all data-driven, and follow a process of performing experiments to gather data for supercomputers to build an increasingly accurate model of life, the universe, and everything. They are all at approximately the same tech level so you are free to choose your order of development, however, each one requires a specific resource to some degree, so take a look at your solar system before deciding which science to research first.\n\n[img=item/se-astronomic-science-pack-4] Astronomic science focuses mainly on space logistics.\n\n[img=item/se-energy-science-pack-4] Energy science is mainly energy production, power transfer, and high tech gadgets.\n\n[img=item/se-material-science-pack-4] Material science is focused more on heavy industry and direct upgrades.\n\n[img=item/se-biological-science-pack-4] Biological science is focused on character upgrades, medicine, lifesupport, bioweapons, and productivity.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Deep Space Science[/color][/font]\n[img=item/se-deep-space-science-pack-1]Deep space science is focused on exploring the interstellar void, antimatter, and warping spacetime.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Tips & Tricks[/color][/font]\nSpace science production speed and efficiency is increased drastically by unlocking better recipes. Pay attention to alternate recipes that you unlock, in particular the simulation and insight recipes.\n\nA high productivity bonuses in Space science labs is important, it is worth exploring options for the best bonuses.\n\nYou are more likely to be constrained by the speed that you can design new systems than the resource requirements. Don't try to build too big. Bootstrap something simple together first. If you have researched all the tech that you can then you should probably work on the next science pack instead of increasing production.\n\nYou may be able to delay increasing your resource infrastructure until you reach Tier 4 space sciences.\n\nBetter modules and better beacons make a huge difference to production speed.
menu_space_elevators=[img=item/se-space-elevator] Space Elevators
title_space_elevators=Space Elevators
page_space_elevators_text_1=Space elevators link a planet or moon surface with its orbit. The structure provides a direct power and signal connection. Trains can enter the elevator to be lifted to the other surface. Space Elevators are well suited to high-traffic routes where there is a constant need for item exchange but not efficient if items are only moved occasionally. Rockets and delivery cannons have a relatively high cost per stack moved, whereas space elevators have a low cost per stack moved but an ongoing maintenance cost.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Placement[/color][/font]\nThe space elevator structure must be placed snapping to the 2x2 rail grid. When a space elevator is placed, a construction site appears at the same coordinate on both surfaces, land and orbit. If the space is not free on both surfaces then the construction is canceled. If this happens you can click on the GPS tag that appears in the construction canceled message to see the occupied area on the other surface.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Construction[/color][/font]\nThe elevator starts as 2 anchor point structures, but the connection between them, the tether, is unfinished and needs further construction materials. The anchor points act as construction sites that require power and [img=item/se-space-elevator-cable] Space elevator cable to build the full space elevator. The full cost of the tether depends on the radius of the planet or moon. You can see the construction status by opening the space elevator entity. Both ends can contribute to the construction process, but it can be completed by supplying just one side.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Maintenance[/color][/font]\nThe space elevator needs upkeep in the form of additional [img=item/se-space-elevator-cable] Space elevator cable. The biggest influence on maintenance is the passing of time, but each rolling stock that moves up or down the structure also increases the maintenance need slightly. The maintenance costs are also influenced by the size of the planet; a higher gravity well means increased costs overall. You can see the costs of maintenance and transporting individual wagons by hovering your mouse over the parts progress bar.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Wire Connections[/color][/font]\nThe elevator acts as a cross-surface power pole. Power and signal wires connected to the middle section of the elevator structure will be directly connected to the opposite side's structure. This connection requires the tether to be built in order to transfer power and signals.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Train Connections[/color][/font]\nThe space elevator can be renamed, this changes the internal station names for both ends of the elevator, they each have an arrow suffix indicating up or down. Trains can use the elevators automatically if the internal elevator station is set as a destination. It is not recommended to manually navigate a long train through the elevator (because player input gets detached from the train when you switch surfaces so you need to keep tapping forwards to not get stuck). If a train gets stuck there is an option in the space elevator settings to force the carriage forwards, but there needs to be enough track for the carriage to move forwards. With this option enabled you should also make sure that the exit is always clear of other trains otherwise the train pushed forwards will force its way into other trains and rail blocks.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Energy[/color][/font]\nThe space elevator has an energy buffer, split between the two anchors. Energy is consumed from this buffer to push a train into orbit, and sending a train down from orbit will charge the buffer. The structure won't move a new train unless there is a minimum amount of energy in the buffer. You can see how much energy sending a rolling stock up the elevator will cost by hovering your mouse over the energy progress bar.
menu_energy_beams=[img=item/se-energy-transmitter-emitter] Energy Beams
title_energy_beams=Energy Beams
page_energy_beams_text_1=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Coronal Mass Ejections[/color][/font]\nStars in the area frequently eject dangerous streams of particles. It is not uncommon for a planet or moon to stray into one of these particle streams. If you have a large base on an affected surface you should evacuate, diversify or disperse your assets, or build an Umbrella defence facility with a large accumulator backup. If you have a small base it is fairly likely to go unscathed. When a surface is threatened there will be at least 4 hours early warning. Known threats will be listed below.
page_energy_beam_warning_text=[img=virtual-signal/se-star] Warning: Coronal mass ejection heading for __1__.\nEstimated defence requirements: __3__ GW peak power, __4__GJ over 120 seconds. ETA: __2__s.
page_energy_beams_text_2=[img=item/se-energy-beam-defence] [font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Umbrella: Energy Beam Defence[/color][/font]\nThe energy beam defence facility, "Umbrella", can protect against coronal mass ejections and space-based energy beam weapons. It works by levitating magnetic particles into a protective bubble, then realigns and clumps the particles as needed to diffuse hostile energy beams. The only requirement to function is energy, the base draw is 10MW but increases based on the strength of attacking beams. Only 1 is needed per surface against Coronal mass ejections, against energy beams weapons 1 Umbrella can defend against up to 500GW of attacking power. For a coronal mass ejection, the base power requirement for a 5000 radius planet and 100% solar, is expected be around 160GJ over 2 minutes with a peak power draw of 2GW at the 1 minute mark. This is increased or decreased with the zone's solar power multiplier, and for solid bodies it is increased or decreased based on the radius relative to a base radius of 5000. For an energy beam from an Energy Beam Emitter, the power requirement is expected to be 1/10th of the energy beam strength at the target (after efficiency loss).\n\nThe "Umbrella" can defend both a planet/moon and its orbit from coronal mass ejections and energy beams. Placing the "Umbrella" either on the planet/moon or in the orbit will protect both zones.\n\n[img=item/se-energy-transmitter-emitter] [font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Energy Beaming[/color][/font]\nThe Energy Beam emitter is capable of sending energy to different surface. It can do this in 2 main ways, either as a way to provide power to a distant surface, "Energise", or as a cutting beam weapon, "Glaive". When in Glaive mode the beam damages an area continuously but can be moved over the target surface cutting a path. The damage rate, area, and beam speed increase based on the energy put into the beam. "Auto-Glaive" mode has autonomous target selection.\n\nAn Energy beam emitter has 4 connection points where Energy beam chambers can connect end-on. Energy beam chambers can connect length-ways, or have a long edge meet the middle of a short edge, but cannot connect directly side-to-side. Energy beam injectors attach directly to the sides of Energy beam chambers. Each Energy beam injector increases the power of the connected Energy beam emitter. To collect power from a beam you need an Energy beam receiver at the target surface and select it as the target using the targeter from the emitter. Once the beam has the receiver as the target the receiver will heat up. The heat can be taken from heat connections at the side to power heat exchangers and turbines.
menu_spaceships=[img=virtual-signal/se-spaceship] Spaceships
title_spaceships=Spaceships
page_spaceships_text_1=Spaceships are huge, powerful vehicles that can launch many contained structures, items, and players into space, then rocket around the solar system to land on other surfaces.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Spaceship Construction[/color][/font]\nSpaceships are made from many tiles and smaller components that fit together to make a spaceship of your own design. You design a spaceship almost like a mini moveable base.\n\nStart with a floorplan of spaceship flooring. Don't build too big, as your first few spaceships will have strict size restrictions, expandable by research. Place spaceship walls around the edges to make bulkheads, and make sure there are no gaps (including diagonals). Place a spaceship console somewhere in the inside, this is the core part of the spaceship and how you control it. When the console is placed, there are some pulses as the console figures out what parts are properly attached, what parts are properly contained and what will fall off if you try to launch. If any squares flash red, then there is an issue with your design, which you can diagnose by checking the spaceship console. You also need a spaceship rocket booster tank, and a spaceship rocket engine. The booster tank is what stores the fuel you need to get into space and provides the VTOL component. The rocket engines are for the slower burn through space to get you to your destination. Some form of defence in the front (always north) is also advisable because the nebula you are in is full of debris.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Integrity Stress[/color][/font]\nEarly on, you will be very limited on spaceship size by the Integrity Stress limits of your technology level. Additional technology lets you build larger spaceships. Integrity stress is calculated in 2 parts:\n\nPart A. Hull stress mainly based on the size and shape of the ship.\nPart B. Container stress based on the item and fluid storage capacity of the ship.\n\nThe total integrity stress is whichever stress factor is larger, the two values are not added together. If your structural stress is 250 and your container stress is 280, the integrity stress will be 280.\n\nThe Hull stress bar shows 3 values. The first is the current discounted hull stress based on empty spaceship tiles. Up to 10% of a ship's size does not count towards integrity stress if it is empty spaceship tiles. This clear space is discounted in the stress calculation and is useful for corridors. The second value is the hull stress with no discount and is useful to estimate the ship stress value you would have if you fill the interior with structures. The third value is the max stress your tech level will allow.\n\nExceptionally long thin ships, or ships with very thin sections in the middle are less sturdy than more rotund designs. Wide ships are sturdy but must clear more asteroids.\n\nSome structures have special effects on the ship integrity or speed, such as the Nexus.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Streamlining[/color][/font]\nThis area of space is in a gritty nebula. If you streamline your spaceship you can improve you spaceship's maximum speed by around 30%. Making a flat box front should be avoided, but don't need to build a wedge. Up to 1/3 of your spaceship's front can be flat with no penalty. Circular shapes should also be fine. You can manually trigger an integrity check to see how the streamlining is going.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Speed[/color][/font]\nShip speed is based on the thrust of the engines vs the ship weight (approximated by integrity stress). Engines can be placed in/on the ship, but engines at the back of the ship with empty space behind are more effective. Fully enclosed engines are 60% effective. Engines at the edge of the ship also have a slight advantage.\n\nYou can set a target speed for the ship to aim for. If the ship exceeds the target speed then it will start disabling engines to more closely match the target speed and save fuel. There are 3 speed limit options, so you can further reduce your speed for high asteroid areas that might otherwise overwhelm your defences.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Long Haul Activities[/color][/font]\nWhen considering long distance travel, it is worth noting that you can do a lot in satellite mode while your body is in transit. You can also give orders to spaceships remotely via the satellite uplink.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Crafting Machines[/color][/font]\n[color=#ffaaaa]Warning: A crafting machine designed for space will only be able to use recipes shared by other land structures if the spaceship is on land. If a space-based recipe is set while the spaceship lands, the ingredients will be lost. Some land-based crafting machines can function in space, but they will lose the ability to use productivity modules while in space. If the spaceship launches with productivity modules in these machines, the productivity modules are destroyed.[/color]\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Spaceship Signals[/color][/font]\nThe top right section of the spaceship console can be connected with wires separately from the main structure, as it outputs its own signals:\n[img=item/se-spaceship-console] The console number indicates the spaceship's ID.\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-speed] The speed signal number indicates the spaceship's speed: -1 if stopped, -2 if anchored.\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-distance] The distance signal indicates the distance to the selected destination: -1 if arrived, -2 if anchored, -3 if no destination is set.\n[img=virtual-signal/se-planet-orbit] A fourth signal indicates the current destination, if any.\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-D] Certain parts of space have more or less asteroids that your ship will encounter. The density of asteroids where the ship is currently positioned is indicated with the D signal.\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-A] If the spaceship is anchored then it indicates the anchored zone id with the A signal.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Spaceship Automation[/color][/font]\nThe main structure of the console can accept signal inputs on the left side:\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-speed] The speed signal sets a target speed and engages the engines. A negative signal stops the engines instead.\n[img=virtual-signal/se-spaceship-launch] A positive Spaceship launch signal triggers a launch.\n[img=virtual-signal/se-planet-orbit] A destination signal sets the destination (you can see a zone's signal from the Universe Explorer side panel once you have constructed a spaceship).\n\nNote: Both the destination signal's type (ex. [img=virtual-signal/se-planet-orbit] or [img=virtual-signal/se-asteroid-belt]) and the signal's value/id must match for the destination to be set.\n\nNote: A spaceship console will not accept [img=virtual-signal/se-spaceship-launch] Launch or [img=virtual-signal/signal-speed] Speed inputs until a player has manually launched and engaged the ship at least once. This is to prevent blueprinted spaceships from accidentally launching while still in the middle of being built by bots.\n\nNote: The console only checks for changes to the input signal every second; a sustained signal is required for the ship to react, single tick pulses will not work.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Circuit Signal Passthrough[/color][/font]\nSpaceship clamps have a power and circuit network connection point in their upper corner. When clamps are connected during automatic landing, the power and circuit network signals are joined, allowing for power and circuit signals to be passed between the ship and the landing location.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Automatic Landing[/color][/font]\nTo cause a spaceship to land, the console must be given a pair of anchor signals, either:\n"anchor using left clamp" ([img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-left-clamp]) with "anchor to right clamp" ([img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-to-right-clamp])\n"anchor using right clamp" ([img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-right-clamp]) with "anchor to left clamp" ([img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-to-left-clamp])\n\nThe value of the "anchor using ..." signal must match the value of a clamp on the ship.\nThe value of the "anchor to ..." signal must match the value of a clamp at the destination.\nYou can see and change these values on clamps by opening a clamp's UI. If a match is found for both the "anchor using ..." and "anchor to ..." signals given to the ship console, then the ship will try to land with the two clamps connected. Use with caution.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Clamps[/color][/font]\nTo set the ID of a clamp, open the clamp GUI and change the numeric value of the clamp signal to the ID you wish for the clamp to have. You never need to change the type of the clamp signal.\n\nYou can disable an anchored clamp by passing it a red signal.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Landing Example[/color][/font]\nThe spaceship has a left-clamp with ID 315. In that clamp's GUI the signal is [img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-left-clamp] with a value of 315.\nThe landing surface has a right-clamp with ID 147. In that clamp's GUI the signal is [img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-right-clamp] with a value of 147.\nIn order to get the spaceship to land using those two clamps, the left side of the ship console must be passed the following signals:\n[img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-left-clamp] 315\n[img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-to-right-clamp] 147

title_arcospheres=Arcospheres
page_arcospheres_text_1=Arcospheres are near perfect spheres of nano-engineered naquium crystal. They are of unknown origin, but are most commonly found floating deep in interstellar space.\n\nEach one encompasses an extra-dimensional knot in space time and allows you to interact with a small 4th spatial dimension. The spheres can be polarised so that they can manipulate certain aspects of space time if moved relative to one another. Sets of specific arcospheres can be used to warp and weave spacetime into higher dimensions. \n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Usage[/color][/font]\nArcospheres are the most unique production challenge in the game. They are used as tools in recipes but are never destroyed, they are only altered. The main challenge in their use is cycling through the spheres you have so you don’t end up running out of a specific type. There are many ways to balance production, but a few combinators can help a lot. If you get stuck ask for hints on Discord, or find more info on the space exploration wiki.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Collection[/color][/font]\nArcospheres are found by launching an Arcosphere collector from an asteroid field. Repeated launches have diminishing returns. You might get better returns by launching from different asteroid fields.

The glyph at the center of the large cartouche seemed to be the most significant in whatever information the system was trying to convey. Whatever the information is, it is formatted unlike anything else I've seen. Behind the cartouches was some kind of raised cylinder containing a powerful device that I can use as a module. Modules of this quality are so valuable that it is worth trying to find more of these structures. Maybe it is time for some archeology.

I anchored the distortion field to the local stars, decoded the non-numeric glyph coordinate system, and reverse engineered the dialing system. My mind feels warped by such alien concepts, but it works and I have finally made a portal home. The trip home, to a galaxy far far away took but a moment. I leave behind an autonomous interstellar empire, built from the ground up by my own hand. My legacy in this space will live on.

se-deep-space-belt-yellow=Yellow transport belt, splitter, and underground recipes can be disabled to reduce UI clutter.
se-deep-space-belt-green=Green transport belt, splitter, and underground recipes can be disabled to reduce UI clutter.
se-deep-space-belt-cyan=Cyan transport belt, splitter, and underground recipes can be disabled to reduce UI clutter.
se-deep-space-belt-blue=Blue transport belt, splitter, and underground recipes can be disabled to reduce UI clutter.
se-deep-space-belt-magenta=Magenta transport belt, splitter, and underground recipes can be disabled to reduce UI clutter.
se-show-zone-preview=Uncheck to disable the zone preview window in the Universe Explorer. If you have some of Factorio's debug overlays active, the preview window can reduce FPS.
se-pylon-charge-points=Uncheck to remove construction pylon charge points. This helps control bot charging behaviour, but you may need to add other charging options along long distance routes.
se-cmes-max-frequency=The max interval for repeating Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). The value is in hours, 0 = disabled. The first CME is scripted to the first minute of the game and is mostly harmless. The second is delayed by roughly 48 hours. The delay between repeats is between 50% and 100% of the max interval setting. A non-zero setting only applies to new events; once an ETA has been set, it won't be affected. A zero setting will clear all scheduled CMEs, though it may take up to a minute for the change to take effect.
se-spawn-small-resources=Adds some additional small resources patches to the starting area. The resource patches are in a cluster to reduce time running between resources.
se-show-overhead-button-satellite-mode=Show a small button on the top left of the screen to toggle the Navigation Satellite Uplink.
se-show-overhead-button-interstellar-map=Show a small button on the top left of the screen to toggle the Interstellar Map.
se-show-overhead-button-universe-explorer=Show a small button on the top left of the screen to toggle the Universe Explorer.
se-show-pin-help-tooltip=Show an expanded tooltip on the pin buttons that gives instructions on how to use them.
se-scan-search-budget=Satellite scanning: The number of already-revealed chunks that can be checked and skipped in one second. High values let it speed through already scanned chunks to get to the uncharted edge.
se-scan-chart-budget=Satellite scanning: The number of unrevealed chunks that can be charted in one second. New chart requests won't be made if the previous chunks are still being generated.
se-scan-alert-interval=The interval in seconds between surface scan update alerts. Revealing surfaces increases game save file size so it is best not to leave one on and forget it.
se-scan-max-range=Satellite scanning: The maximum range (in tiles) that scanning is allowed to go from the surface origin before stopping. Planets will never be scanned beyond their radius and the maximum planet radius is 10000 tiles. Values larger than 10000 tiles will only apply to space zones.
se-core-seam-map-tags=When enabled, any time a core seam is uncovered, it will automatically be marked on the map with a map tag.
se-lifesupport-hud-visibility=Choose when to have the Lifesupport HUD visible.
se-supercharger-individual-charge-rate=Sets the charging rate of each individual charging port in the supercharger, in MW (does not affect maximum charge rate). Minimum (default) value is 90 MW, enough to charge a vanilla robot in one tick, up to 1000 MW, or 1 GW, the maximum charge rate of the supercharger.
se-dropdowns-hide-low-priority-zones=Hide low-priority zones in dropdown menus for destination selection. When on, only zones with priority greater than or equal to the value set in the "Priority threshold" setting will be shown. Zone priority can be modified in the Universe Explorer.
se-dropdowns-priority-threshold=Threshold value, below which a zone will not be shown in dropdown menus for destination selection. Does nothing if "Hide low-priority zones in dropdown menus" is off.
se-blueprint-snap-clamps=If a spaceship clamp is included in a blueprint, snap the blueprint to the rail grid to make sure that the clamp can be placed.
robot-attrition-factor=A multiplier on the robot chance to crash.\nNote: In Space Exploration, this multiplier affects 100% of the robot interference of your homeworld, and 50% of the interference of other zones.
se-add-icon-labels=Some recipe and item icons may be difficult to tell apart. This setting adds numbers or letters overlayed on the icons to make them more distinctive. For example, observation frames and catalogue tiers.
se-delivery-cannon-artillery-timeout=Weapon delivery cannon artillery requests timeout after this many seconds if unfulfilled.
kr-stack-size=Increases stack size of many vanilla and K2 items. (Default: No changes)
