Version: 0.6.121
Date: 13. 01. 2024
  Info:
    - This version contains major breaking changes for Krastorio 2 players. See full changelog for details.
    - No changes for Space Exploration players without Krastorio 2. (As a reminder, you cannot add Krastorio 2 to an existing save file, it must be present from the start of a game)

  Compatibility:
    - [K2] Major changes:
      - Added a guaranteed Imersite Moon to the starting solar system. (Only affects new games, existing universes are not modified)
      - The Advanced Tech Card and Singularity Tech Card have been changed to Advanced Science Pack 1 and Advanced Science Pack 2, each with their own catalogs and set of data cards similar to the current Matter Science Packs.
        * When updating your save file, all existing Gravimetrics Facilities that were set to the previous recipes will be mined and put into an iron box.
        * A log file line will be written in case this migration fails to save the contents of the Gravimetrics Facilities. With that in mind, keep a backup of your save, as log files are overwritten each time you launch Factorio.
      - The four Solid Rocket Fuel recipes have been rebalanced, generally improved:
        * The changes are meant to reduce the required throughput of Oxygen, reduce the amount of machines needed, and to try and create a viable use case for each recipe, while still ensuring that rocket fuel is not a viable option for power generation.
        * As part of this, the energy usage of Atmospheric Condensers, Electrolyzers and the Krastorio 2 "Advanced" buildings has been increased.
        * Efficiency modules can no longer affect Atmospheric Condensers or the Electrolyzer's two water recipes. Existing efficiency modules will be spilled and marked for deconstruction after updating.
      - Voiding recipes in the K2 Crusher are generally slower:
        * Voiding recipes now return their input 75% of the time.
        * Voiding takes longer for buildings, tiles, or other placeable items.
        * Landfill can no longer be voided.
      - Heat Capacity of Water and Steam reduced from 0.5KJ to 0.3KJ, bringing it closer to the Space Exploration standard.
        * This change means you will need to provide more water to your Heat Exchangers and High Temperature Heat Exchangers to achieve the same results.
      - Reduced the stats of the Logistic and Construction Robots, bringing them in line with Space Exploration values.

    - [K2] Other recipe changes:

      - Increased the Oil output of Core Fragment (Oil) processing.
      - Increased the ore return on filtering dirty water.
      - Increased Sand required for Particle Stream recipe, decrease output of Particle Stream recipe.
      - Updated the recipes for loaders to bring them closer to the AAI Loaders.
      - Adjusted the Lithium production chain to avoid Chlorine creation with up to Prod 9 modules.
      - Rebalance Matter Liberation recipes to make them more favoured over the Sand recipe.
      - Reverted Low Density Structure recipe to original SE recipe. Beryllium version is unchanged.

      - Equipment Categorization has been overhauled, intending to create a more meaningful player choice in whether they wear Power Armour or Thruster Suit.
      - Hydrogen now has a fuel value of 50KJ as a starting point for any future balancing.
      - Logistic Science Pack technology prerequisite changed from Electronics to Electric Lab.
      - Toolbelt 5 technology prerequisite changed from Larger Containers For Logistic System to Optimization Tech Card.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.109
Date: 22. 07. 2023
  Features:
    - The Space elevator now directly connects the electric networks on both sides. This means elevator power transfer is now bidirectional and unlimited.
      NOTE: To connect your electric networks, you will need to make sure that the "Space elevator wire connection" in the center of the elevator is connected to your base on both sides by copper cable.

  Changes:
    - Space elevator signal wires now require the elevator to be built in order to transfer signals.
    - Added some mouse-over tooltips to the Space elevator GUI with details on cable and energy consumption.
    - The guaranteed biter-free zones of the homesystem are now also guaranteed not to have vitamelange, to prevent biters and biter meteors. This does not affect existing games.
    - The modules found in a certain type of place are now shuffled in a way that ensures a more equal distribution of each type. The first module per force is also guaranteed to be productivity.
    - The cost to research some technologies related to t2 astro science has been slightly reduced to better match the other three specialist sciences (Microwave + x-ray telescope and gravimetrics technology costs halved.)
    - Spaceship walls and doors can now be fast-replaced with each other.
    - Achieving a second victory type in the same save file will now make the Factorio victory screen appear again.
    - Added a custom message on the victory screen.
    - Increased selection priority of cargo pods so that they can be mined more easily when they land on top of a building.
    - Some recipes were made to process in smaller batches to avoid a Factorio bug where a machine would stop if a stack in its output is above the stack size of the item. This should not cause any ratio change or other gameplay change. Recipes affected: Vitamelange nugget, Vitamelange bloom.
    - Added `se-reset-seam-tags` command which can reset all map tags of core seams in every zone.
    - The "Material catalogue 4" technology now requires the "Space platform plating" technology (which is needed as an ingredient for a data card).
    - Minor changes to the technologies descriptions for the combination significant data simulations.
    - Minor changes to the technology description of beryllium/holmium pyroflux smelting to clarify the efficiency gain.

  Optimizations:
    - Space elevator power consumption code now updates less frequently.
    - Small performance improvements for spaceships and glaive beams.

  Bugfixes:
    - Launching a satellite rocket won't trigger win-related achievements and events anymore.
    - Fixed Station Picker GUI staying open when switching from a force with access to the GUI to a force without access, which could cause crashes.
    - Fixed Station Picker GUI crash when clicking on the "choose station" button after the train had been removed.
    - Fixed being unable to add stops to any trains if you had a train stuck in a space elevator.
    - Fixed the space elevator "force carriages forwards" option still accelerating blocked trains when the elevator is unbuilt, which could cause a "Trying to change direction of automatic train" crash.
    - Fixed that meteors could land out of bounds of a planet.
    - Fixed crash when exiting navsat view after someone else took control of your character (e.g. admin commands).
    - Fixed crash when generating a ruin with tiles of a type that had been removed. It will instead fallback on a different tile type. (#299)
    - Fixed crash when launching/landing a spaceship with a train that has a temporary stop in its schedule.
    - Fixed "Astromaterial simulation" recipe name not matching the technology name.
    - Fixed typo in asteroid field name.

  Compatibility:
    - Fixed issue when using Schall Autolinked Chest and other linked chest mods. Non-SE linked chests will now work but may not be placed on spaceships.
    - Removed `ingredient_count` legacy field from many buildings, which could block recipes from other mods if they had too many ingredients.
    - Casting machines can now be moved with Picker Dollies.
    - Moved core fragment recipe generation to an earlier step to avoid conflict with Bob's library.

  Locale:
    - Removed some duplicate and unused locale lines.
    - Updated Thai translation, thanks to windMew.
    - Updated Russian translation, thanks to Shadow_Man.

    - Fixed centrifuge description still using the vanilla description.
    - Fixed being able to target cannons and beams outside of a planet's radius.
    - Fixed issue where if two trains were coming into a space elevator at the same time (one going up and one going down), one would be forced to wait for the other. (#289)
    - Fixed a small issue in the universe's generation's randomness, which may have selected some planets more frequently than others.
    - Fixed "Unknown key" showing on entities with placement restrictions and no description
    - Fixed that picking the respawn options "Closest landing pad/spaceship" when the zone you died on has several landing pad/spaceship would respawn you at a random one instead of the closest one.
    - Fixed the "robot attrition factor" setting not having any effect when changed after the start of a game.
    - Fixed robot interference being too high for non-Calidus asteroid belts and orbits. This especially affected zones far from their stars such as asteroid belt 2s.

      In multiplayer games, only admins can abandon surfaces. This feature cannot be used for spaceships yet.

  Changes:
    - The stone/sand/wood byproducts in all resource processing chains are now unaffected by productivity. You will get proportionally less stone/sand/wood the more productivity you use.
      Recipes changed: Beryllium sulfate, Crushed holminite, Crushed iridite, Vitamelange nuggets.
      Possible breaking areas:
      - Vitamelange processing now always needs sand, instead of starting to give sand at productivity tier 8.
      - Beryllium processing now starts needing sand at productivity tier 3, instead of tier 4 currently.
    - Now cannonable: Cryonite slush barrels.
    - Spaceship names now display rich text in map view. (Requires Factorio 1.1.77 or higher)

    - Fixed strange behavior when moving a train into an elevator that's out of power, moving the train backwards, then re-powering the elevator.
    - The space elevator internal tug locomotive can no longer be mined, deconstructed, or damaged.
    - Fixed crash when SE fails to transfer an equipment to a new grid.
    - Fixed using remote view to continuously mine, pickup items, or repair.
    - Fixed misaligned graphic between cargo rocket silo and its ghost.
    - Fixed rare crash when deleting a surface with an active CME.

  Compatibility:
    - [K2] Space loaders share fast_replaceable_group with space belts.

    - Added open/close sounds to many entities who were missing one.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed space capsules on board spaceships leaving behind orphaned unmineable lights and shadows upon spaceship launch. Any such orphaned entities should get cleaned up upon loading the game.
    - Fixed crash in some circumstances when a train without a locomotive went through the space elevator.
    - Fixed that rocket fragments created from rockets that fail to land could hit entities on their way to crashing when using Combat Mechanics Overhaul. This could cause rocket fragments to destroy belts and rails way more often than intended.
    - Rocket fragments no longer have any collision, to stop them from blocking the reconstruction ghosts of entities they destroy (Although they should now destroy things only very rarely thanks to the fix above).
    - Removed misleading "+300 integrity" text from the Spaceship technology (300 is the base, the technology does not add any).

  Scripting:
    - Custom events are now raised upon a player entering or exiting remote view.

  Compatibility:
    - Space Blueprint Converter now additionally uses fast_replaceable_group to attempt to find a compatible conversion source.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.91
Date: 16. 12. 2022
  Features:
    - Added Blueprint Converter shortcut and keybind. Use this to convert a blueprint's entities between their space and ground variants. This conversion applies to rails, transport belts and their components, pipes, assemblers, and tiles.

  Changes:
    - Now requires Factorio 1.1.72 or higher.
    - Slightly reduced costs for astronomical catalogue 3 and material catalogue 3, and slightly increased costs of material catalogue 2. This puts them more in line with the costs of other catalogues and makes sure that the higher tiers of insight recipes are actually upgrades. Recipe ingredients are unchanged so this will not break your setups though it will affect ratios. Details below:
      - Dark matter data: 50% more likely to produce data (30 percentage points).
      - Pressure containment data: (Nerf) Only outputs 1 card at a time, down from 3.
      - Corrosion resistance data: (Nerf) Takes 2 more glass and material testing packs.
      - Ballistic shielding data: Outputs 2 cards at a time, and takes 2 fewer magazines.
      - Explosion shielding data: Outputs 2 cards at a time.
      - All recipe speeds adjusted so that the cards-per-second rate is unchanged.
    - Cargo rockets now account for the red inventory limit bar. The E and F signals and the "On cargo full" launch condition will not count barred stacks.
    - Landing pads marked for deconstruction are no longer considered valid targets for cargo rockets.
    - Added location of detected hostiles to "Confirm extinction" failure message.

  Optimizations:
    - Energy beam optimizations.

  Bugfixes:
    - Swaped the order of the Infrared data and Visible data recipes so they match the order of their observation frames.
    - Fixed trains going to a stop with exactly 1 empty train slot, wrongly waiting in "destination full" status when coming out of the space elevator.
    - Fixed planets with the "Mountains" climate tag not actually being generated with high cliffs.
    - Fixed spaceship engines still generating smoke after being destroyed.
    - Fixed elevator's `on_train_teleport_finished_event` not returning the correct old train id.
    - Fixed space capsules rarely landing out-of-map when target coordinates are close to map edge.
    - Fixed meteors landing on ungenerated chunks on a planet or moon orbit not falling through to the surface below.

  Compatibility:
    - Fixed compatibility with Memory Unit and Fluid Memory Unit.
    - Mods that use "Items with inventories" can now be used with SE. Items with inventories cannot be transported between surfaces.
    - Packing Tape is no longer marked as incompatible.
    - Spaceship consoles can no longer be built on non-SE surfaces (such as inside Factorissimo buildings) as that could lead to crashes and other unexpected behavior.

Version: 0.6.89
Date: 16. 10. 2022
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed cargo rockets launching prematurely if the launch trigger was set to green signal when cargo full.
    - Fixed "View-surface" sometimes taking you to the wrong position in Nav-view from the Universe Explorer if you previously had a spaceship selected.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.88
Date: 16. 10. 2022
  Features:
    - Redesigned the Navigation Satellite GUI to be a lot more compact. The new GUI defaults to the bottom left corner of the screen but can be moved to a different location and will remember that location the next time it is opened. The GUI gets a small extension to its right to display pins, if you happen to have any on the surface being viewed. The number of pins visible before scrolling depends on your screen resolution.
    - Redesigned the Universe Explorer.
      - Flags displayed in the universe explorer are now configurable. Click the Flag icon in the toolbar to choose which flags should be displayed, up to a maximum number.
      - Added new flags for zones that have a generated surface, meteor defense installations, meteor point defenses, and energy beam defense.
      - Added a new column, which displays delta-v between a zone and a player-selectable "reference" zone.
      - Players can modify the reference zone by Shift + left-clicking a zone in the list.
      - Double-clicking a zone in the zone list now closes the Universe Explorer and takes you to its surface in Navigation Satellite view.
      - Shift + left-clicking a zone type in the toolbar will now hide all zone types other than the one selected.
      - Ctrl + left-clicking a zone type in the toolbar will show all zone types.
      - Zone names are color-coded by type.
      - Spaceships have their ID appended to their names in the Universe Explorer, in order to allow ships with non-unique names to be distinguished.
      - Added sorting indicators to column headers that appear if a column is being used for sorting.
      - The right panel is now broken down into collapsible subsections, "Details", "Resources", "Environment", "Anchored Spaceships", and "Pins".
      - A new section "Anchored Spaceships" will show a list of spaceships anchored in a selected zone, if there are any.
      - A new section, "Pins" will show player pins that target the selected zone. The pins can be edited, previewed, or opened in navigation satellite view.
      - Zone names in the right zone data panel are now clickable. Clicking on a zone name will select it in zone list and display its details.
      - The surface preview frame will now show a camera-view for spaceships and a map-view for all other zone types.
      - The surface preview frame will take up much less space in the UI if the zone has no generated surface.
      - Added a new button to the titlebar to show/hide the surface preview frame in the zone data section.
      - Moved the buttons to scan/delete/trim a surface to the bottom right, next to the "View Surface" button.
      - Trim and delete surface buttons now require a second click for confirmation.

  Changes:
    - Cargo rocket silos now support inventory filters. The last two slots are automatically filtered for cargo rocket sections and space capsules, to ensure that they can always be inserted. Once a rocket is ready, those filters are automatically removed, allowing you to make use of the rocket's entire cargo capacity.
    - Offshore pumps will now disappear on spaceship launch if you manage to get them inside a spaceship.
    - Improved fuel pass-through speed when connecting cargo rocket launch pads to each other using pipes.
    - Suffocation damage will now affect health directly and will no longer set your shields to 0 (This could accidentally give you the Golem achievement).
    - Space elevator now snaps to the rail grid before being placed.
    - Energy beams will now jump to target coordinates if they are sufficiently far from their existing positions.
    - Pyroflux steam recipe now has a new name so it can be found when searching for "pyroflux".
    - Preserve resources under the edge of core seams
    - The temperatures of Very hot and very cold planets are slightly less extreme (does not affect existing games).
    - Reduced the empty space tile walking speed from 0.1 to 0.05 (Only noticeable at very low spacewalking thrust and very low velocity).
    - Added new planet or moon: Cinza.
    - Added new planet or moon: Snezon.
    - Added new planet or moon: Norfair.

  Compatibility:

    - Fixed navsat inventory being lost if you were using navsat view while your character was in a train going through a space elevator.
    - Fixed crash if you tried to open the inventory of a space capsule that had one of its component entities destroyed.
    - Fixed crash that could occur if a secret structure and core seam randomly spawned in colliding positions.
    - Fixed crash when driving a train through an elevator while in editor.
    - Fixed crash when setting a train to automatic and reversing its direction while it is currently entering an elevator.
    - Fixed spaceship engines efficiency% text not appearing. Also added some colors to it.

Version: 0.6.87
Date: 03. 10. 2022
  Changes:
    - Reduced overall vitamelange costs of tier 3 and 4 biological catalogues. This puts them more in line with the costs of other catalogues, and makes the tier 3 and 4 biological insight recipes viable again. Recipe ingredients are unchanged so this will not break your setups though it will affect ratios. Details below:
      - Significant biomass: 33% more likely to produce a significant biomass per vitalic reagent (10 percentage points), but takes double the neural gel.
      - Bioelectric data: Outputs 3 cards at a time, but takes 4 times more ion stream.
      - Cryogenics data: Outputs 3 cards at a time, takes and outputs 3 times more thermofluid.
      - Comparative genetic data: Outputs 4 cards at a time.
      - Decompression resistance data: Outputs 10 cards at a time, and 50% more likely to keep your significant biomass and output data instead of junk data (25 percentage points). Overall a x15 buff.
      - Neural anomaly data: Halved the Advanced neural gel consumption.
      - Radiation resistance data: 60% more likely to keep your significant biomass (30 percentage points).
      - All recipe speeds adjusted so that the cards-per-second rate is unchanged.
    - Tweaked sounds and animations for condenser and high-temp turbines. High-temp turbine will no longer stutter when partially used.
    - The technology icon for "Universal simulation" now shows a quantum supercomputer, to indicate the minimum level of supercomputer required for this recipe.
    - Added new planet or moon: Robbebol.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash on space capsule landing if you deconstructed the capsule extremely fast.
    - Fixed some non-pump-type entities being placeable in space if they had "pump" in their name.
    - Fixed core seams sometimes destroying secret structures if they happened to spawn close to one another.
    - Fixed a crash that could occur if a player character was killed and the surface they died on was destroyed before the player had respawned.
    - Fix for removing character armor while in nav view deletes armor equipment
    - Fixed used lifesupport canisters being permanently lost if you consumed a lifesupport canister without having enough space in your inventory. When your inventory is full, the used canister will now fall to the ground and be marked for deconstruction.
    - Fixed energy beams not correctly moving towards the target set by the player if they had previously been in "auto-glaive" mode and identified their next enemy target.

  Compatibility:
    - Fixed crash, implemented compatibility with Black Rubber Belts by Deadlock989.

Version: 0.6.86
Date: 01. 09. 2022
  Features:
    - Redesigned the Lifesupport GUI. The old Lifesupport GUI has been replaced with a much smaller HUD. The HUD can be moved and will remember its location. By default, this HUD will be visible whenever you have lifesupport equipment or you are in need of lifesupport. This visibility setting is configurable for each player.

  Changes:
    - Arcochests can now be connected to the circuit network to read their contents.
    - Changing your character's armor will now empty your lifesupport buffer.

    - Fixed spaceship not activating engines if you clicked Engage too fast after launching.
    - Fixed icon for "processed fuel from methane gas" recipe.

  Compatibility:
    - Spaceship booster tanks and rocket landing pads can now be moved with Picker Dollies.
    - Loader-type entities are now treated similar to transport belts and get space layer collision by default, unless `se_allow_in_space` is set to true in their entity prototype. This ultimately shouldn't result in any gameplay changes—you'll still be able to build space and deep-space loaders in space.

    - Vitalic acid is now a fluid, does not require glass, and is a chemistry recipe.
    - Non-end-product recipes that use holmium, beryllium, iridium, or vitalic product chain ingredients have had costs reduced based on the new item value.
    - Naquium requires less naquitite but more of other materials. The refining process is in general more complicated.
    - Naquitite intermediate products stack size has increased from 10 to 20.
    - Reduced spaceship victory tech cost from 10000 to 5000.
    - Calidus Asteroid Belt 2 will always be methane ice primary.
    - The tech tree around rocket science has been restructured to smooth out the difficulty spike.
    - Rocket science no longer requires data cards, machine learning, thermofluid, or supercomputers.
    - Added Computer science, an upgrade of rocket science that requires data cards, machine learning, thermofluid, and supercomputers.
    - The recipe for thermofluid has changed. The alternate cryonite recipe has been removed, the base recipe now requires cryonite.
    - The upgraded space radiator is now a T4 item, is 3x faster than the base radiator, and costs less power.
    - The rocket techs for cargo safety, reusability, and survivability now have a level and cost specifically for for computer science. This means that the techs with multiple levels are the 4+ tech instead of the 3+ tech, and due to engine limitations previous tech levels will be lost on updating.
    - To fix your cargo safety tech level you can use: /c game.player.force.technologies["se-rocket-cargo-safety-4"].level = #
    - To fix your reusability tech level you can use: /c game.player.force.technologies["se-rocket-reusability-4"].level = #
    - To fix your survivability tech level you can use: /c game.player.force.technologies["se-rocket-survivability-4"].level = #
    - Higher tier insight recipes give more insights.

      - Any meteors not shot down in the orbit of a planet/moon will now fall through to the surface below if not stopped by terrain.
        Meteors that land on space scaffold or platform may now destroy it. This can only happen if doing so will not destroy any entities in the process.
      - Meteor defence installations (not point defences) will protect both a planet/moon and its orbit.
    - Umbrella defences now protect both the planet/moon and its orbit. (CMEs are still on separate timers and will only target one of the two).
    - Split first satellite unlocks into the first 3 satellites to avoid introducing too many new features and info at once:
      The first satellite will unlock Navigation Satellite view, second will unlock the Universe Explorer, Star Map, and Nauvis Orbit. Only the third satellite and onwards will discover new planets/moons.
    - Add keybind for the Star Map view (default: Y).
    - The first-view location and default preview location for Nauvis orbit is now on a point of interest instead of the the surface origin.
    - Rework of spidertrons deployment from cargo rockets:
      - If a spidertron has inventory filters set (middle click in inventory), it will attempt to fill its filtered slots from the rocket cargo.
      - If a spidertron has no inventory filters, it will attempt to take 1 stack of any item matching these item types: Inserters, Solar panels, Accumulators, Substations, Roboports, Construction Bots, Logistic chests, Signal transmitters, Laser turrets.
    - Meteor point defences improvements:
      - Meteor point defences now get an orange tint when in Overcharge mode.
      - The charging mode of meteor point defences will now get preserved in blueprints, or when using copy-paste.
      - Modified the type of one of the components of meteor defence installations and point defences, so that it no longer appears in the production section of the electric network. Upon updating, all of your meteor defences will start recharging as a result.
      - Copy pasting meteor defence on logistic chest now sets an ammo request. Thanks to Quezler.
    - Adjusted animation speed of space buildings so that their baseline animation speed appears when filled with speed3 modules.
    - Biochemical facility now has recipe tints like the vanilla chemistry plant.
    - Added new planet or moon, Raven.

    - Fixed a crash that would occur if the player toggled charging modes on a meteor point defence that was on board a flying spaceship.
    - Removed spaceships from energy beam emitter zone selection dropdown (They already could not be selected, but were still visible in the list).
    - Fixed a migration issue where a no-longer-valid LuaEntity reference could stop cargo rocket launch scripting events from getting raised.
    - Fixed construction pylons and radar construction pylons losing their circuit connections when they are built over ghosts, if placed by a player instead of a construction bot.
    - Fixed probes inappropriately returning data cards when launched from the wrong zone type if their stack sizes had been increased (by a different mod) and more than one probe was being launched.
    - Fixed a crash that would occur if a player started a cutscene while in Navigation Satellite view and tried to close it while their character was located on a different surface.

  Compatibility:
    - Generators with a power density higher than the HT turbine have an integrity cost.
    - Improved compatibility with mods that listen to the on_player_pipette event and modify the cursor stack.
    - Spidertron deployment from rockets now works with modded spidertrons too. Modded spidertrons that need fuel will also attempt to take fuel from the rocket cargo as they deploy.
    - Added a check that allows other mods to stop a surface from getting deleted using the Universe Explorer. Mods that wish to do so can add `space_exploration_delete_surface` to their remote interface.

    - Many deep space science level recipes have been rebalanced.
    - Spaceships now have a streamline mechanic (you may have noticed that this area of space has a lot of rocks), so cut those corners off your box ships for some extra speed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Changed core mining output to be proportional to planet size. For an average Nauvis this means roughly double the fragments.
    - Mixed core fragment (from Nauvis) has reduced values for most resources (-50%).
    - Removed setting for electric boiler.
    - Electric boiler is now a crafting machine and you can choose the steam temperature (or evaporate away water).

  Changes:
    - Space science is now required on average 1 tech later in many tech lines.
    - Rocket silo research is now cheaper and faster.
    - Meteor defence installation accuracy reduced to 80%.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.33
