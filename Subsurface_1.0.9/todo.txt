uranium ore, better oil fields only in subsurfaces
underground lvl 1 not available under oil fields and water
Different textures for different subsurface levels (e.g., stone for the second level, darker textures for deeper levels).
unbreakable Rock-Spots (biome patches)
Rocket silo construction, stage 1 clears subsurface
rocket-silo needs drilling (like RSC but not that much)
find abandoned shelters (as secret) but as sealed entrance from above
smoke/smog in polluted chunks
rocket silos cant be placed above exposed underground and underground cant digged when there is a rocket silo above
support for https://mods.factorio.com/mod/AbandonedRuins
Biters https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Subsurface/discussion/65cd6a8f4294e70fb2eeaca3 dig to both exposed and unexposed (not really, spawn when players dig to them) chunks
biters are harder in underground (respect peaceful mode!)
better tech and recipe cost
alien biomes integration (rocks and ground tiles), rock decals on the ground, migration regenerate_decoratives(), Krastorio graphics, EIGENE noise exp, erst rock-small autoplace to ne
drilling efficiency (stone amount) depends on terrain
areas of "hard" stone (or like minecraft, below layer 3)
"camera" (drone) entity that enables map view of underground; remote view like se and integration into its gui bottom left
aai zones, miners
surface drilling tech needs electrical minig drill
subsurface walls and entrance/exit vulnerable to explosion, on_entity_died (dont show damage indicator)
smoke (and pollution) when sealing
achievements
menu simulation, if the community grows
vehicle elevator (rocket silo door sound)
pollution fix
vent and elevator placement requires boring
elevator indicator directly on the entity (rendering sprite)
informatron page which explains which resource is where
lava in 3rd or deeper level
terrain adaption to SE climates
caveground transitions nur mit out-of-map, auch cavewalls grafik benutzen
crude oil random probability check, Kanidaten von topsurface kopieren

Resources:
- SE planets have no ores, they are all in the underground
- prospector: find possible patch candidates but also nulls (reliability research in percent)
- another prospector that works underground (gives direction and distance)
smaller patches on top surfaces, bigger ones deeper at the same position
vulcanite only in underground (small patches on top)
keep ore prospector to predict richness and size and level
bz diamond always ug

Surface drill:
- create small holes and smoke while drilling (graphics_set)
- slowly clear subsurface randomly in given area, resource patch amount is reduced proportionally
- deeper( from lvl 1) drillings needs fluids
- lubricant as maintenance
- like RSC, some items (steel, concrete, lamp) which are actually used for the elevator (maxbe turn to fluid)
- light source on both ends
- invisible mining drill, visible assembler?
- maintenance chest and pipe, content and descr. in drill gui
select what to drill (elev. vehicle elev., fluid/item/heat elev)
